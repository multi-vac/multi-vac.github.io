I’m Ankit—or multi-vac, or simply, multi. The pseudonym comes from [The Last Question](http://www.thelastquestion.net/), a short story by Asimov. It may be hubris to name your online persona after a superintelligent machine, but we have to live with our choices.

I'm a full-stack developer and a team lead at [BriteCore](https://britecore.com).

When I'm not working I like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59893490-ankit/) and [write]({{< ref "/poems" >}}).
