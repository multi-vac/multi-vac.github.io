I’m Ankit—or multi-vac, or simply, multi. The pseudonym comes from [The Last Question](http://www.thelastquestion.net/), a short story by Asimov. It may be hubris to name your online persona after a superintelligent machine, but we have to live with our choices.

I'm a software engineer and a team lead at [BriteCore](https://britecore.com).

When I'm not working I like to [read]({{< ref "/now-reading" >}}), [write]({{< ref "/poems" >}}), and think about [paperclips](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer).
