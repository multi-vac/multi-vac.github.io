a feeble orange light\
knocks on her window\
wanting to be let in\
as it pours in the city\
and inside of her\
\
in each other’s arms\
we become the elements itself\
i’m parched earth\
desperate\
to soak your raining self in\
\
a lightning strikes\
and we’re birds flying home\
fluttering our wings in harmony\
trying to hold onto time\
but it slips away\
\
the clouds clear\
and a cold breeze blows\
i look into your eyes\
and see the ocean\
deep\
marble blue\
we’re swimming in it\
you won’t let me\
see the chests buried deep\
it’s pain you say\
and we swim along\
\
we’re primordial humans\
running into the setting sun\
dancing naked\
barefoot\
on grass\
around a fire\
with tears leaping from our eyes\
\
we’re streams\
of ice cold water\
flowing down a mountain\
born in the spring\
tussling\
becoming one and separating\
turning everything green\
\
i’m light\
trying to steal a glance\
from your window\
when it starts raining\
\
she relents and lets\
the soaking wet light in\
her heart full of jagged scars\
bruised and mended\
over and over again
