a hundred billion livers and hearts, once warm with blood and desires\
a hundred billion hues and cries, forever stretched in time\
a hundred billion with infinite pain, misery and envy\
a hundred billion threads of skin, woven hastily and cut short\
a hundred billion dreams i had, of doom, cement and steel\
a hundred billion puppets with no master, swinging in the wind\
a hundred billion victims of death, on whose graves we skip merrily
