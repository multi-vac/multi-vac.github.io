a hundred billion livers and hearts, once warm with blood and desire\
a hundred billion hues and cries, forever stretched in time\
a hundred billion burdened with infinite pain, misery and envy\
a hundred billion threads of skin, woven hastily and cut short\
a hundred billion dreams i had, of doom, cement and steel\
a hundred billion puppets with no master, swinging in the wind\
a hundred billion wounds and boils that won't heal\
a hundred billion stranded in the parched desert, dying of thirst\
a hundred billion fables and stories, never to be heard\
a hundred billion laughs and smiles, forever buried in the stone\
a hundred billion breathes and footsteps, engraved in the sky\
a hundred billion skulls turned to ashes\
a hundred billion victims of death, on whose graves we skip merrily
